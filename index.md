## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

My name is Tanish Mittal. Currently, I am pursuing MSc. Physics and B.E. Computer Science in BITS Pilani, Pilani campus. I am interested in Deep learning and Physics. In Machine Learning, My current interest lies in Computer Vision and Deep Reinforcement Learning.  I also have fair knowledge of data structures and algorithms. My preferred programming languages are Python, C++ and MATLAB.

## Experience
North Eastern Space Application Centre (NESAC), Umiam, Meghalaya | **Summer term**  
*Under the guidance of Sri Nilay Nishant, Engineer, NESAC [June 2021 - July 2021]*
* Predicting map Segmentation of Built-up Area from Satellite Images
    1. Created a dataset containing sentinel images of Indian cities and corresponding built-up mask.
    1. Implemented a six level Attention-UNet model with self-trainable balanced Binary Cross Entropy loss function
    1. Achieved an overall accuracy of 99.8%
    1. Currently writing a Machine learning research paper for this project.
* Development of cloud native geoprocessing framework using open source tools
    1. Developed a high-level open-source python API for doing complex computations on satellite images.
    1. Integrated Django as backend server with the python API to deploy Machine learning based algorithms.
    1. Currently writing a research paper regarding the high-level python API also.

    *Under the guidance of Mr. Santosh Yadav, PhD, BITS Pilani[June 2021 - Present]*
    1. Used Low Dose CT Image and Projection Data by The Cancer Imaging Archive
    1. Implemented a non-overlapping window-based self-attention Vision Transformer for Medical Image Denoising
    1. Introduced a novelty in Existing Transformer by adding edge enhancing convolution kernels
    1. Achieved 43.487 PSNR, 0.0067 RMSE and 0.9861 SSIM which is better than previous State-of-the-art
    1. Submitted a short four page research paper to ICCVWâ€™21 CVAMD which is currently under-review
* Reinforcement Learning-based Decision Support system for COVID mitigation   
   *Under the guidance of Dr. Kamlesh Tiwari, BITS Pilani and Dr. Heena Rathore, UT San Antonio [June 2021 - Present]*
    1. Carried a thorough literature review on Reinforcement Learning and COVID pandemic
    1. Proposed new methods involving Reinforcement learning for COVID Decision Support system
